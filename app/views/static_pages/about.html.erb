<h1>About</h1>
<p>At age ten I began playing competitive basketball on the second best team in the province. When I was 12 I became a soccer referee. After turning 16, I became a fully-certified lifeguard and began working for the City of Hamilton. Age 18 I graduated from Bishop Tonnos High School and began my studies at the Goodman School of Business in Brock University. I was in the dual degree program, and went on exchange for 1.5 years at EBS, a prestigious business school in Germany. During my time at University I had two internships; one doing sales at PepsiCo and the other at Pulse Advertising as a marketing intern.</p>
